Course Overview
=======

📘 This course provides students with a foundational understanding of computer programming through the Python language. It emphasizes both the practical skills and conceptual knowledge needed to write, debug, and analyze code. Students learn core programming constructs such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and lists, and are introduced to topics like input/output handling, error checking, and basic problem-solving techniques. The course also integrates hands-on assignments where students implement small programs, such as grade calculators and interactive loops, to reinforce learning through practice. By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to design and write simple, well-structured Python programs that demonstrate logical thinking, algorithmic problem solving, and proper coding style.
