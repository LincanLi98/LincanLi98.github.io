Short Bio
======
Hi everyone. I'm currently a PhD student at [Responsible AI (RAI) Lab](https://yushundong.github.io//students/), [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/), Florida State University. I feel very much fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Yushun Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_QUhuOMAAAAJ&hl=EN). My research interests include Spatial-Temporal Data Mining, Graph Neural Networks, AI+X, LLMs & Foundation Models. In general, I'm always highly interested in broad machine-learning fields, application of heterogeneous data mining, and AI+X technologies.
